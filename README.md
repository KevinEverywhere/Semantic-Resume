Page style from [Sheets-of-Paper](https://github.com/delight-im/HTML-Sheets-of-Paper).

## Structure

- everything is wrapped in the `<main>` element.
- we use `<section>` to hold a section, like Education or Projects.
- inside an `<section>` element, we use `<details>` and `<summary>` to divide multiple subsections.
